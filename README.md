Project README: Deep Learning Projects with RNN and LSTM

Overview

This project explores the implementation and analysis of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to address a specific sequence prediction task. The work includes a detailed research paper, Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, and supplementary resources.

Purpose of the Projects

RNN Project: This notebook investigates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks to model sequential data and analyze their performance in predicting patterns in temporal datasets.

LSTM Project: Building on the limitations of standard RNNs, the LSTM implementation demonstrates the ability to manage long-term dependencies and prevent vanishing gradient issues commonly encountered in RNNs.

Key Conclusions

RNNs are effective for modeling short-term dependencies but struggle with long sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem.

LSTMs address these issues through mechanisms like forget gates and memory cells, providing superior performance for long-sequence tasks.

Experimental results highlight LSTMs' significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency over standard RNNs for the given sequence prediction problem.
